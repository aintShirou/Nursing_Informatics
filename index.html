                    <h1>Nursing Informatics</h1>
                    <p class="p">Nursing informatics (NI) was one of the lesser known nursing specialties, even though it has been a recognized specialty for over 30 years. The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) defines NI as “a specialty that integrates nursing science with multiple information management and analytical sciences to identify, define, manage, and communicate data, information, knowledge, and wisdom in nursing practice.”</p>

                    <p class="p">Due to the increased implementation of technology such as the electronic medical record (EMR), NI has been gaining in popularity and the number of informatics nurses is growing. With the anticipated emergence of the EMR as the primary tool for documenting and communicating patient information in the coming years, the role of an informatics nurse is becoming more important.

                    <p>The definition guides role description for nurses interested in informatics and recommends components of practice, education, training, and research, and supports the legitimacy ofthepractice and the general competencies of a nurse who specializes in informatics. The definition is the introductory element shaping documents of national scope for the NI specialty.In addition, the definition is used by funding agencies to outline projects and fund NI efforts, such as the Division of Nursing in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the National Institute for Nursing Research (NINR).</p>
                    <p>The profession of nursing was among the first health disciplines to embrace informatics through its recognition of NI as a specialty practice area (Bickford, 2015). In littleover twodecades, NI has evolved into an expanding body of knowledge, confirming and supporting its relevance and applicability to all domains of nursing (e.g., education, research, practice information management and technology, administration).</p>
                    <p>It not only supports nurses but also other providers, patients, and stakeholders indecision-making to ultimately enhance healthcare outcomes.

                <h1>Key Principles</h1>
                <p>With the rapid evolution of NI, many organizations are beginning to recognize the impact and value NI professionals can have on the quality of patient care, including improved safety. Nurse informaticists impact workflow, facilitate communication between IT and nursing, as well as support more acceptance of clinical systems used in healthcare on a daily basis. <br>A number of organizations have provided guidelines and standards of practice for the discipline of NI. Of these, there are the ANA's (2015b) Nursing Informatics: Scope and Standards of Practice, AACN, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), the QSEN initiative supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), and the TIGER initiative, to name a few. <br>
                    Regardless of the organizational framework used or regulatory body, all organizations and regulatory agencies are in consensus that there is a need for all nurses to understand these basic guiding principles and have NI knowledge, skills, and competencies in order to practice better, high-quality, safer patient care. The contributions of the different organizations are discussed in the following text.

                    <p>The ANA has developed its own standards and scope of practice for NI. Nursing Informatics: The Scope and Standards of Practice (ANA, 2015b) describe the common performance, level of care, and quality of practice for which nurses are accountable. There are two main levels of standards for NI—the NI standards of practice and the professional performance standards. </p>

                    <p> Standards of Practice for Nursing Informatics are guidelines for practice that have bothgeneral and specific recommendations for the specialty; general recommendations follow the nursingprocess of assessment, planning, outcome planning, diagnosis, implementation, and evaluation.Standards of Professional Performance for Nursing Informatics speak to the nursing role with regardto ethics, research, education, and resource utilization.

                <div class="tab-contents" id="Education">
                    <p>The CCNE, which falls under the umbrella of the AACN, ensures nursing programs meet a certain set of quality standards. The scope of CCNE includes the accreditation of BSN and NI degree programs. Its purpose is to accredit BSN programs that are in compliance with standards of practice as defined and required by other organizations and to monitor programs' continuous quality-improvement (CQI) efforts. The CCNE recognizes that education plays a key role in nurses being able to build the fundamental knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary to become leaders as well as public advocates for their patients and profession </p> 
                </div>
                <div class="tab-contents" id="Quality">
                    <p>TThe overall goal of the QSEN initiative is to meet the challenge of preparing future nurses who will have the knowledge, skills and attitudes (KSAs) necessary to provide high quality safe healthcare (Cronenwett et al., 2007). Gaps were identified in NI knowledge, education, and skills required for nurses to competently use EHRs to provide patient care (Cronenwett et al., 2007; Disch, Barnsteiner, & McGuinn, 2013). This initiative is discussed in subsequent chapters as it applies to their specific content. </p>
                    <p>Based on the IOM recommendations, the QSEN initiative developed NI competencies that closely examine the nursing KSAs needed in BSN programs. Of the six key areas involved in KSA competencies, the most relevant here include quailty improvement, patient safety, and informatics.</p>
                    <p>The KSA definitions for NI as well as sets of KSAs for the informatics competencies that were created for use in nursing prelicensure programs and BSN education programs. These are suggested as guides for NI curricular development, and allow transition to practice or to other education program.</p>

    <div class="title">
        <h2>Evolution of Nursing Informatics</h2>
        <p>When first introduced, Nursing Informatics focused mainly on the technology that made up field of nursing, and very little about its users, nurses, and those who benefitted from the technology, patients. As a result, the definitions became information technology-oriented definitions. </p>

        <p>As the decades progressed, the specialty of nursing informatics shifted focus to a more conceptual framework. Researchers sought to anticipate the need for technology, versus reacting to a problem that arises from technology. With conceptually-oriented definitions in mind, theories evolved the definition of nursing informatics to include nursing information and goals as well as users. However, even with a more updated definition of nursing informatics, the changing times called for another changing definition.</p>

        <p>As healthcare, nurses, and other specialties entered the 1990s, it was clear that technology had pushed and changed the path of healthcare and would continue to do so. In addition, a new emphasis was placed on decision-making processes and the impact on patient care. As the specialty looked at the impact informatics had on these aspects, it was clear that a more focused definition was needed to hone in on the specific roles within the field of nursing informatics.</p>

        <p>Role-oriented definitions began to emerge and focus more on the nursing informatics specialist instead of the specialty itself.</p>

                <summary>Why is Nursing Informatics Important?</summary>
                <p>Nursing Informatics integrates nursing, computer and information sciences to support the identification, collection, processing, and management of data and information that nurses use to develop knowledge, educate patients and their families and administer effective patient care.</p>
                <p>As professions in healthcare become increasingly specialized, individual patients engage with teams of healthcare providers, all of whom provide different services and separately update the patient’s electronic medical records. To provide safe and consistent patient care, nurses require timely access to patient information that includes recently undergone procedures, medical background, lists of prescribed medications, records of medication administration, laboratory and imaging results and more.</p>
                <p>With timely access to information, nurses can enhance patient safety by reducing medical errors, eliminating duplicate procedures and reducing delays in the patient care process through more streamlined clinical communications. In the past, nurses who developed expertise in informatics were known as nurse informaticians. Today, there is an increasing demand for all nurses to develop the basic competencies of nursing informatics and incorporate them into daily practice.</p>

                <summary>Applications of Nursing Informatics</summary>
                <p>Advances in information technology and data processing, along with the widespread availability of EHR, are supporting an increasing number of applications for nursing informatics. Here are just a few applications that are enjoying widespread use today:</p>

                <p> Clinical Practice – Nurses can record the results of their patient assessments in an electronic health record. Applications that support this practice can capture data that describes the workload of nurses and the clinical interventions that they perform on each patient. Electronically charted information is immediately available for other authorized individuals in the patient’s care team.</p>
                    
                <p>Education – Distance learning courses are a common example of nursing informatics.</p>
                    
                <p>Administration – Nursing managers involved in hospital or healthcare administration can review software-generated Management Information System (MIS) reports and analyze them using specialized healthcare informatics applications to assess day-to-day operations and discover possible sources of error or opportunities to increase efficiency.</p>
                    
                <p>Research – The proliferation of patient data into the digital domain has led to the development of online knowledge bases where nurses can conduct research. These data can also be used as a “standard” data set against which nurse-sensitive patient care outcomes can be measured.</p>
